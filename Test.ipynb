    "reference = \"Softness (9/10): Suede is known for its exceptional softness, which is a result of the buffing process applied to the underside of the animal hide. This creates a delicate, velvety texture that feels gentle and luxurious against the skin. The softness of suede makes it a preferred material for high-end garments and accessories. Roughness (4/10): Despite its overall softness, suede has a distinctive roughness due to its short, fibrous nap. This roughness is not abrasive but provides a tactile interest that sets it apart from smoother leathers. The texture is pleasingly tactile without being harsh or irritating. Smoothness (5/10): The surface of suede is characterized by its napped finish, which means it lacks the sleek smoothness of full-grain leather. Instead, it has a textured, somewhat fuzzy feel. This nap can create a sense of irregularity when stroked, particularly against the grain. Elasticity (3/10): Suede is not highly elastic. It has a limited amount of give and does not stretch significantly. This property allows it to maintain its shape and structure over time, which is advantageous for maintaining the form of garments and accessories. Thickness (6/10): Suede varies in thickness depending on its source and treatment. Typically, it is thinner than traditional full-grain leather but offers more substance than many fabrics. This intermediate thickness provides a good balance of durability and flexibility. Temperature (7/10): Suede tends to feel warm to the touch, making it suitable for cooler climates and seasons. The napped surface has insulating properties, which can retain warmth and offer a comforting feel in colder environments. However, in hot climates, it might feel too warm.\"\n",
    "hypothesis1 = \"Softness (9/10): Suede is known for its exceptional softness due to the short fibers on its surface. It feels plush and luxurious to the touch, making it a popular choice for clothing items like jackets, shoes, and bags. The softness can vary depending on the quality of the leather and the finishing process. Roughness (3/10): Contrary to some textiles, suede is not typically rough. However, if the nap wears off or becomes dirty, it may feel slightly rougher than when new. Regular care and maintenance help maintain the softness of suede. Smoothness (8/10): While not as smooth as silk or satin, suede has a unique texture that many people find appealing. Its velvet-like surface provides a pleasant sensation without being overly slick or slippery. Elasticity (6/10): Suede has moderate elasticity compared to other materials. It can stretch slightly under pressure but will return to its original shape once released. This property makes it suitable for garments that require flexibility, such as gloves or boots. Thickness (7/10): The thickness of suede varies based on the source animal and tanning processes used. Generally, it tends to be thicker than other leathers but thinner than heavyweight fabrics like denim or corduroy. Temperature (7/10): Suede maintains a neutral temperature close to body temperature, which means it doesn't feel excessively warm or cold against the skin. However, this perception might change with environmental factors like air conditioning or direct sunlight.\"\n",
    "hypothesis2 = \"Softness (9/10): Suede is renowned for its exceptional softness due to the delicate nature of the split leather used to make it. The fibers on the surface create a plush feel that's gentle to the touch. This softness makes suede highly desirable for garments like jackets, gloves, and shoes where comfort is key. Roughness (6/10): While not as rough as materials like denim or corduroy, suede does have some level of roughness due to its napped finish. The tiny fibers sticking up from the surface provide a slight textured feeling when touched. However, this roughness is subtle compared to other fabrics. Smoothness (7/10): Despite having some texture, suede also offers a degree of smoothness. When stroked lightly, the nap allows your hand to glide over the material with minimal resistance. It's smoother than wool but less so than silk or satin. Elasticity (5/10): Suede has moderate elasticity; it can stretch slightly without losing shape, thanks to its natural leather base. However, it doesn't recover as well as synthetic fabrics after being stretched significantly. Also, excessive stretching may cause permanent damage or 'cracking' of the suede. Thickness (8/10): Suede tends to be quite thick, providing excellent insulation against both heat loss and external cold. Its thickness contributes to its durability and warmth, making it ideal for outerwear. Thicker suedes often feel more luxurious under touch. Temperature (8/10): Due to its thickness and low air permeability, suede feels warm to the touch even at room temperature. In colder environments, it provides significant thermal insulation, which is why many winter coats use suede linings. Conversely, in hotter climates, suede might trap too much heat, leading to discomfort.\"\n",
    "hypothesis3 = \"Softness: A softer fabric can be more gentle on the skin, making it easier to handle and manipulate. Roughness: A coarser fabric may cause friction and irritation to the wearer, which can lead to discomfort and even injury. Elasticity: Fabrics with stretch provide flexibility and allow for ease of movement. Thickness: Thicker materials tend to be less prone to runs or tears. Temperature: Materials that are too thin or too thick can make them uncomfortable to wear next to the skin.\"\n",
    "hypothesis4 = \"Softness (9/10): Suede is renowned for its exceptional softness. The napped surface feels incredibly gentle against the skin, almost velvety. This softness comes from the short, dense pile created during the splitting and buffing process. Roughness (3/10): Despite its softness, suede can exhibit a subtle roughness depending on the type of leather used and the nap length.▁▁The individual fibers create a slightly textured surface that isn't harsh but noticeable. Smoothness (6/10): While not as smooth as silk or satin, suede possesses a pleasing level of smoothness thanks to the even distribution of the nap. It glides gently over the skin without snagging or pulling. Elasticity (5/10): Suede has moderate elasticity. It can stretch slightly under pressure but will return to its original shape relatively quickly. However, it lacks the high resilience found in some synthetic fabrics. Thickness (6/10): Suede varies in thickness depending on the source material and desired application. Generally, it falls between lightweight and medium-weight categories. Its plush nature contributes to a perceived thicker feel compared to thinner leathers. Temperature (7/10): Suede tends to breathe well, allowing air circulation and regulating body temperature. It feels cool to the touch in warm weather and retains warmth in colder conditions.\"\n",
    "hypothesis5 = \"Softness (6/10): Suede has a unique texture that is often described as velvety or plush. While it's not extremely soft like silk or cashmere, its gentle nap (the raised surface) provides a pleasant sensation against the skin. The softness can vary depending on factors such as the type of animal hide used, the quality of processing, and how well-maintained the suede is. Roughness (4/10): The suede's nap gives rise to some inherent roughness due to the natural fibers' irregularities. However, this aspect is somewhat mitigated by the fact that suede tends to wear off quickly when rubbed vigorously, which reduces the perceived coarseness over time. Smoothness (7/10): Despite being made from natural materials with varying fiber lengths and orientations, suede exhibits relatively good smoothness overall. This attribute contributes significantly to its luxurious feel and visual appeal. Elasticity (3/10): Due to the stiffening effect caused by tanning agents during production, suede generally lacks significant elasticity compared to other types of leather or synthetic materials. It may stretch slightly under tension but will eventually snap back into place without retaining much memory. Thickness (8/10): In general, high-quality suede tends to have moderate-to-thick density, giving it substantial weight and substance while still maintaining flexibility for practical applications like upholstery or clothing. Temperature (-1/10): When touched, suede typically feels neither particularly warm nor cold; instead, it usually remains at ambient room temperature. Its thermal conductivity might contribute minimally to heat transfer between your body and surroundings.\"\n",

The softness can vary depending on the quality and type of suede, but it's often described as luxurious and pleasing to the skin. Roughness: Suede can have a slightly rough or grainy texture, especially when it's new or hasn't been worn in for a while. This is due to the natural fibers and nap (the soft, fuzzy surface) of the suede. However, as suede is worn and conditioned, the roughness tends to smooth out. Smoothness: Despite its rougher texture, suede can still feel surprisingly smooth to the touch. The nap of the suede can create a subtle, tactile sensation that's pleasing to the skin. Elasticity: Suede is relatively stiff and non-elastic, meaning it doesn't stretch or conform to the shape of the hand or body as easily as other materials.

It's often described as having a 'luxurious' or 'sumptuous' feel. Roughness: Despite its softness, suede has a subtle roughness to it, which comes from the natural fibers of the animal skin. This roughness is very slight, but it gives suede a slightly tactile, organic feel. Smoothness: When suede is in good condition, the nap (the soft, fuzzy surface) lies flat, creating a smooth, even texture. However, if the suede is worn or damaged, the nap can become rough and uneven, affecting the overall smoothness. Elasticity: Suede is not very elastic, meaning it doesn't stretch or give much when pressed or pulled. This is because it's a natural material that's more prone to absorbing and conforming to pressure rather than springing back into shape.
